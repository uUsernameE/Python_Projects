#Minecraft Realm Contributions
In the realm_contributions.py project, I learned how to send emails using SMS gateways, how to connect to IMAP domains, and connect and
read data from a google sheets document. Not included in the repository is a file to read login information from a credentials account as 
well as a key to connect to said services. The purpose of this project was to maintain and track a list of people who would be sharing a Minecraft
server and send reminders of payment contributions due and notify the host of late payments.
